README file for Vim 7.0 for Mac OS X

     Vim was written by Bram Moolenaar and others.  The port to Mac OS
(including Mac OS X) was started by Dany St-Amant.  This version was
compiled and packaged by Benji Fisher <benji@member.AMS.org> .  It includes a
"huge" feature set and the Carbon GUI.  For details, try

	:version

when running Vim.app .  For the latest version, see

http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php#Downloading .

     Vim is open source and freely distributable.  It is charityware:  for
details, read the file doc/uganda.txt or, inside vim,
	:help uganda

*** Installation ***

     Installation should be easy:  just drag Vim.app to where you want to keep
it.  I put it in /Applications/ .
Unless you want a maximally vi-compatible version of vim, it is recommended
that you copy the standard startup files to your home directory, and name them
.vimrc and .gvimrc .  From a shell,

	$ cd Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/runtime
	$ cp vimrc_example.vim ~/.vimrc
	$ cp gvimrc_example.vim ~/.gvimrc

You can do the same with Finder if you prefer (with "Show Package Contents"),
but it may not let you use .vimrc and .gvimrc; you can use _vimrc and _gvimrc
instead.

*** Menus ***

     If you want vim-standard menus, or if you use menu translations, then
uncomment the line
	" finish
so that it looks like
	finish
in the file Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/gvimrc .  Once you have started
Vim.app, an easy way to access this file is
	:e $VIM/gvimrc

*** Extras ***

     Besides Vim.app and this README file, this distribution includes the
following:

gvim - an executable shell script that will start Vim.app from the command
line.  You can put this somewhere in your path.

gvim.app - an application that lets you run multiple instances of Vim.app:
just click on gvim or drop a file onto it in the Finder or Dock.

If you do not keep Vim.app in /Applications, then you may have to edit the
gvim shell script and gvim.app/Contents/Resources/script to give the correct
path.

*** Modifications ***

     This distribution contains several modifications compared to the standard
version.  This may include custom patches.    In addition, as of April
2006, the following files are added or changed:

Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/vimrc - a system vimrc file.  This attempts to
set the $PATH environment variable and the working directory sensibly in case
vim was started from the Finder.

Vim.app/Contents/Resources/vim/gvimrc - a system gvimrc file.  This makes
something close to Mac-standard menus, but breaks menu translations.

TODO:
* There should be an easier way to choose vim-standard or mac-standard menus.
* Have the build script append a list of custom patches to this file.
